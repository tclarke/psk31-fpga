# clion-verilog-template
A template I use for HDL (mosty verilog) CLion projects.

This is mostly geared toward the open source build chain for Lattice chips (especially on the Icestick dev board). I occasionally build for Xilinx products as well.

Since CLion doesn't currently support custom project templates you should fork this repo as a basis for a new project then create a project from the new repo.
